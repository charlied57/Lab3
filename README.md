2 - You can detect an overflow by detecting when the value turns negative.
    An overflow occurs when you sum values of 257 and over
3 - An overflow occurs when you sum values of 4294967297 and over
4 - You can detect an overflow when the value turned into infinity
    An overflow occurs when the product of 1 to 37 is attempted
5 - An overflow occurs when the product of 1 to 171 is attempted
6 - The expected outcome of the function summation(1/n) -1 is zero
    As the value of n gets bigger the accuracy of the floating point is lost so the answer is not zero
7 - The for loop should not run when the value of i is 4.4 but it does. This is because of the accuacy of floats.
8 - The loop no longer runs at 4.4 when the type double is used.
